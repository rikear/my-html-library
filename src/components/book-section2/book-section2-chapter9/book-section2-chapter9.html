        We should always aim to build websites and applications to be as lean as possible. The benefits of faster sites are well documented for all meaningful metrics. As far back as 2009, Google was publishing its findings on the importance of page speed: https://services.google.com/fh/ files/blogs/google_delayexp.pdf.

        Images are by far the biggest contributor to website "weight," a significant contributor to web page speed, or lack thereof. Looking at the data from the 2021 Web Almanac at ht tps: //almanac. httparchive.org/en/2021/page-weight#images, we can see images accounting for almost twice as much weight as the next largest resource, JavaScript:

        <h2>
          Median page weight by content type
        </h2>
