        Bonus Techniques and Parting Advice
      </h2>
      <p>
        In my favorite stories and films, there's usually a scene where a mentor passes on valuable advice and some magical items to the hero. You know those items will prove useful; you just don't know when or how.
        <br><br>
        Well, I'd like to assume the role of mentor in this final chapter â€”besides, my hair has waned, and I don't have the looks for the hero role. I would like you, my fine apprentice, to spare me just a few more moments of your time while I offer up some final words of advice before you set forth on your responsive quest.
        <br><br>
        This chapter will be half philosophical musings and guidance, and half a grab-bag of unrelated tips and techniques. I hope, at some point in your responsive adventures, these tips will prove useful.

        Here's the grab-bag of tips we'll cover:
      </p>
      <ul>
