        Whenever you create interaction with JavaScript and modern CSS features like transforms, it makes sense to consider things from the lowest possible device you want to support. What about the two people that don't have JavaScript (yes, those guys), or if there is a problem with the JavaScript loading or executing? What if somebody prefers reduced motion? Don't worry. It's possible, with a little effort, to ensure a working interface for every eventuality.

        When building these kinds of interface patterns, I find it most useful to start with the lowest set of features and enhance from there. First, establish what someone sees if they don't have Javas-cript available. After all, it's no use parking a menu off-screen when JavaScript isn't available, if the method for displaying the menu relies on JavaScript. Instead, in this case, we are relying on markup to place the navigation area in the normal document flow. Worst case, whatever the viewport width, they can merely scroll down the page and click a link:
      </p>
      <section>
        <object>
          img here
        </object>
        <p>

        </p>
      </section>
      <p>
        If JavaScript is available, for smaller screens, we "pull" the menu off to the left. When the menu button is clicked, we add a class to the body tag (with JavaScript) and use this class as a hook to move the navigation back into view with CSS transform3d().
