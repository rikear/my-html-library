      <p>
        How much of that can you now understand? We have a system font stack, an @font-face rule loading a variable font (complete with ranges defined for weight and slant), and a sans- serif as the default font -familyâ€”which we then immediately overwrite with a font-family defined with a CSS custom property for browsers that understand it. Finally, we use a feature query for variable fonts and define settings for it, also adding in some additional font features we'd like to see.
        <br><br>
        These are all approaches and techniques that we have covered in this chapter. If you can look at that and have a decent understanding of what is going on, you have done well. There's a lot in there to parse!
