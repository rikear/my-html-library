        You can view each of these clip-path examples in example _08-09.

      <h2>
        Animating clip-path
      </h2>
      <p>
        As if all this clipping malarkey wasn't interesting enough, you can also animate a clip-path, as long as there remains the same number of points in the shape. For example, you can animate a triangle into a different shaped triangle, but without some tricks, you can't convert that same triangle into a star. I say "without some tricks" because you can effectively do this by hiding a few points along the lines of the polygon so your triangle has enough points to animate into a star.

        Here's a grab of an extra example I added, example_08-10. This is just to hopefully give you an idea of what can be done by adding a few of the things we have already learned and a few things we will learn in future chapters together:
      </p>
      <section>
        <object>
          img here
        </object>
        <p>
          Figure 8.28: You can even animate clip-path
        </p>
      </section>
      <p></p>
      This shows two elements with the same background image being masked with clip-path. You can also tint the image with an overlay like this:
    </div>
    <code>
      background: linear-gradient(hsla(Â®, 0%, 0%, 0.4) 0, hsla(0, 0%, 0%, 0.4) 100%), ur1( 'image.jpg');
    </code>
    <p></p>
    You may be wondering, if we wanted to tint the image with a color, why don't we just use a background color in the declaration?
    <br><br>
    The answer is that it doesn't work. When you set multiple backgrounds with the background property, it's not possible to use a background-color, even a semi-transparent one, above an image, and have the color let the image show through beneath.
