        <h2>The < aside> element</h2>
        <p>The aside element is used for content that is tangentially related to the content around it. In practical terms, I often use it for sidebars, or content in a little tip about a related subject in a blog post. It's also considered suitable for pull quotes, advertising, and groups of navigation el-ements. Basically, anything not directly related to the main content would work well in an aside.
        If it was an e-commerce site, l'd consider areas like Customers who bought this also bought as prime candidates for an aside.

        <h2>The < header> element</h2>
        <p>Practically, the header can be used for the "masthead" area of a site's header but also as an introduction to other content, such as an introduction section within an article element. You can use it as many times on the same page as needed. You could have a header inside every section on your page, for example.</p>
        <section>
            <object>
                icon here
            </object>
            <p>Here's what the specification says about header: https://html. spec. whatwg. org/multipage/sections.html#the-header-element.</p>
        </section>
        <h2>The <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> element</h2>
        <p>Like the header, the footer element doesn't take part in the outline algorithm (more on that below) so doesn't section content. Instead, it should be used to contain information about the section it sits within. It might contain links to other documents or copyright information, for example. Like the header, it can be used multiple times within a page if needed. For example, it could be used for the footer of a blog but also a footer within a blog post article on that same blog. However, the specification notes that contact information for the author of a blog post should instead be wrapped by an address element.</p>
