        In the first section of the book, we covered the essentials of responsive web design. We didn't just cover the principles; we took deep dives into media queries and the latest layout systems like Flexbox and Grid.
      <br><br>  
        In Section 2, we concentrated on the CSS features I believe are essential for solving all manner of day-to-day styling challenges. We covered selecting items, typography, new color features, SVG, animations, and heaps more; the sort of tools that you will be using day in and day-out if your work involves CSS. And frankly, if your work doesn't involve CSS, I'm not sure why you are here!
        Mom, is that you?
      <br><br>  
        In the next two chapters, which comprise the final section of this book, I want to cover a couple of broader topics; a bunch of tips, tricks, and techniques that didn't necessarily fit elsewhere, and firstly, in this chapter, some of the latest platform features.
