        So that is how we can provide modern images for browsers that support them, and older, more broadly supported formats to those that don't, all the while providing solid accessibility and meaning with the alt tag in case the image doesn't load or the user can't make use of the visuals.
        <br><br>
        In the prior code, we are just dealing with a single image and different formats of it. That addresses our problem of file weight. Now let's look at how to deal with serving the best image given the situation. For that, we will put aside picture momentarily and make use of another tool, srcset.
        But first, let's be certain we understand the problem we are trying to solve.

      <h2>
        The inherent problem of responsive images
      </h2>
      <p>
        As an author, you cannot know about every possible device that may visit your site now or in the future. Only a browser knows the particulars of the device viewing a website; its screen size and device capabilities, for example.
        <br><br>
        Conversely, only the people making the website know what versions of an image we have at our disposal. We may have three versions of the same image: small, medium, and large, each with increasing dimensions to cater for the anticipated screen size and screen density eventualities.
        The browser does not know this. We have to tell it.
        <br><br>
        To summarize the conundrum, we, as the website authors, have only half of the solution, in that we know what images we have. The browser has the other half of the solution, in that it knows what device is visiting the site and what the most appropriate image dimensions and resolution would be.
        <br><br>
        How can we tell the browser what images we have at our disposal so that it may choose the most appropriate one for the user?
        <br><br>
        In the first few years of responsive web design, there was no specified way. Thankfully, now we have the Embedded content specification: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/ embedded-content.html.
        <br><br>
        The Embedded content specification describes ways to deal with the simple resolution switching of images to facilitate a user on a higher resolution screen receiving a higher resolution ver - sion of images. It also facilitates "art direction" situations for when authors want users to see a totally different image depending on a number of device characteristics (think media queries).
        For example, a close-up image of something on smaller viewports and then a wide-angle image of the same thing for larger viewports.
