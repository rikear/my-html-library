        <p>If that wasn't annoying enough, currently, there is no way of animating the open and close.
        Without JavaScript, there's also no way of toggling other details panels closed when another details/summary combination is open. I'm not sure either of these desires will (or should) ever be addressed. However, I've therefore found the usefulness of these elements pretty limited by themselves. Rather than an all-in-one open/close drawer solution, you should think of them as a way to more semantically facilitate what you would have done previously with a display: none; toggle on a standard div with the help of JavaScript.

        <h2>The &lt;address&gt; element</h2>
        <p>The address element is to be used explicitly for marking up contact information for its nearest article or body ancestor. To confuse matters, keep in mind that it isn't to be used for postal addresses and the like (unless they are indeed the contact addresses for the content in question).
        Instead, postal addresses and other arbitrary contact information should be wrapped in good ol' p tags. I'm not a fan of the address element. In my experience, it would be far more useful to mark up a physical address with this element. However, hopefully it makes more sense to you.</p>

        <p>We have now covered the majority of the sectioning elements of HTML, so we will move on to the text-level elements. These are the elements used to mark up individual words, letters, and symbols to provide explicit meaning as to the intent.</p>
        <h2>HTML text-level semantics</h2>
        <p>Before HTML5, text-level semantic elements were referred to in the specifications as inline elements. Therefore, if you are familiar with that description, be aware that we are talking about the same thing here.
        <br><br>
        The section of the HTML specification that details text-level semantics can be found here: ht tps: // html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/text-level-semantics.html#text-level-semantics.
        <br><br>
        Let's take a look at the most common and useful text-level elements.
