                As ever, you can check support levels at https://caniuse.com/css-subgrid, and read the specification here: https: //www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-2/#subgrids.

        <p>
            In essence, subgrid provides a mechanism for non-direct child elements of a grid ancestor to inherit their grid tracks. Using subgrid is as simple as setting subgrid as the value of either grid-template-columns or grid-template-rows, or both.
            <br><br>
            Let us start with the subgrid value by solving the same problem we solved with display: contents in the last section.
            <br><br>
            When using the subgrid value, instead we would set the CSS for the â€¢ parent like this (you can view the full code in example_05-09):
        </p>
        <code>
            .parent {
            <br><br>
                display: grid; 
            <br><br>
                grid-template-columns: subgrid;
            <br><br>
                grid-column: span 2;
            <br><br>
            }
        </code>
        <p>
            And just like that, this particular problem is solved.
            <br><br>
            However, for solving that particular problem, we have actually used more code than the prior solution with display: contents, but bear with me. We can understand how it works with this simple example before we look at something more involved.
            <br><br>
            First, we are making the parent element a grid, and then crucially telling it that we want the template for the columns to be a subgrid, so that it will inherit the columns from the ancestor grid it is part of.
            <br><br>
            Next, we need to tell the browser how big this element is going to be in the ancestor grid it is part of. Here we have set it to span 2 columns, making it the full width of the ancestor grid, as, remember, the ancestor grid is made up of two columns.
            <br><br>
            With that in place, the grandchild elements happily position themselves in the next available
            column. We don't need to do anything extra with them.
